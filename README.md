# MA-615---Midterm-Project

Just a reminder that for the Project Markdown and Ioslides files to run properly, you need both "samadult.dat" and "SAMADULT.sps" files saved in your working directory. 

In addition, for the Shiny "app.R" file to run properly, you will need the "data.csv" file saved in your working directory.
